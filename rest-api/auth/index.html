<h1>Auth</h1>

<h2 id="oauth2-overview">OAuth 2 Overview</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2 protocol</a> is used to authenticate and authorize every 
API request. OAuth makes it possible for you to act on behalf of {{site.productName}} users without those users needing 
to share their credentials (username/password). This is made possible via a flow where the end user is 
redirected from your application to {{site.productName}} and grants your application permission to an access 
token for a finite period of time. Additionally, </p>

<p>You do not necessarily need to act on behalf of a user; you can 
<span style="font-style: italic">be</span> the end user. For example, you may be creating a script to 
run every night and extract data from your workspace. In this scenario, you must authenticate via the 
OAuth flow, retrieve a token for your account, and hard code that token into your script. Note, however, that 
within the normal authentication process, manual re-authentication will be required at least every 14 days: the process
documented here will not allow a script to run indefinitely without user intervention.</p>

<h2 id="registering-an-application">Registering an Application</h2>

<p>You can retrieve any API key by <a href="../resources/#!/users/add_users_post_2">creating a user</a>, and then using the access token returned to you to <a href="../resources/#!/users-user.id-clients/add_clients_Clients_post_2">create an API client</a>. Take note of the key that is returned to you. It cannot be retrieved again.</p>

<h3 id="registering-an-application-redirect-uri">Redirect URI</h3>

<p>Your application must specify a redirect URI. This is the URI the end user will return to upon 
authenticating with {{site.productName}}. This URL must be set up to look for an OAuth response and process it 
accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="3-legged-flows">3-Legged Flows</h2>

<p>A 3-legged flow is require in a scenario where you want to access <strong>private</strong> data 
on behalf of an end user. You may want to make your API calls from a server-side script (Ruby, Python, 
PHP, etc) or from a web client (HTML + JS). Because server-side scripts are implicitly more secure than 
clients, these two scenarios require different flows.</p>

<h3 id="3-legged-flows-server">Server</h3>

<p>The following describes a typical server-side flow:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Your app needs to acquire a token for a user, and sends that user to: 
	<strong>{{site.authDomain}}/oauth2/v1/authorize?client_id={your API key}&response_type=code&state={a session-based string you use to prevent CSRF}</strong></li>
	<li>The user authenticates with {{site.productName}} and returns to the redirect URI you set up for your 
	application with the following query string appended: 
	<strong>?code={a code which lasts for 30 seconds}&state={the session-based string you passed to prevent CSRF}</strong></li>
	<li>The <strong>state</strong> parameter is checked to ensure it matches the one you passed.</li>
	<li>A <strong>POST</strong> request is made to <strong>{{site.authDomain}}/oauth2/v1/grant</strong> with the following payload: <strong>client_id={your API key}&client_secret={your API secret}&redirect_uri={the redirect URI associated with your application}&grant_type=authorization_code&code={the code you just received back from {{site.productName}}}</strong></li>
	<li>Assuming the code is valid, you will receive a JSON response back with an access token in it: 
		{% highlight json %}
{
	"access_token": "the token",
	"refresh_token": "a refresh token"
}
		{% endhighlight %}
	</li>
	<li>A <strong>GET</strong> request is made to: <strong>{{site.authDomain}}/oauth2/v1/token?access_token={the token}</strong></li>
	<li>Assuming the token is valid, you will receive a JSON response back with an API key in it: 
		{% highlight json %}
			{"client_id": "your API key"}
		{% endhighlight %}
	</li>
	<li>The <strong>client_id</strong> (API key) is checked to ensure it is your own.</li>
</ol>

<p>The access token you have now lasts for 24 hours. You can use it to make API requests which require 
authorization.</p>

<p>Once your token expires, you may use your refresh token (provided in Step 5) to retrieve a new 
access token via another <strong>POST</strong> request to <strong>{{site.authDomain}}/oauth2/v1/grant</strong>.
The payload for this should be:</p>

<!-- TODO: Is the info on refresh tokens here accurate? -->
<p><pre>
client_id={your API key}
client_secret={your API secret}
redirect_uri={the redirect URI associated with your application}
grant_type=refresh_token
refresh_token={the refresh token you previously received from {{site.productName}}} 
</pre></p>

<p>Each refresh token is valid for 14 days. When the refresh token expires, the interactive authentication flow must be
repeated to obtain a new access token and refresh token pair.</p>

<p>A sample server-side script, written in PHP, is provided below:</p>

<h3 id="3-legged-flows-client">Client</h3>

<p>The following describes a typical client-side flow:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Your app needs to acquire a token for a user, and sends that user to: 
	<strong>{{site.authDomain}}/oauth2/v1/authorize?client_id={your API key}&response_type=token&state={a session-based string you use to prevent CSRF}</strong></li>
	<li>The user authenticates with {{site.productName}} and returns to the redirect URI you set up for your 
	application with the following string appended after a # hashbang: 
	<strong>?access_token={the token}&state={the session-based string you passed to prevent CSRF}</strong></li>
	<li>JavaScript is used to parse the parameters after the # hashbang.</li>
	<li>The <strong>state</strong> parameter is checked to ensure it matches the one you passed.</li>
	<li>A <strong>GET</strong> request is made to: <strong>{{site.authDomain}}/oauth2/v1/token?access_token={the token}</strong></li>
	<li>Assuming the token is valid, you will receive a JSON response back with an API key in it: 
		{% highlight json %}
			{"client_id": "your API key"}
		{% endhighlight %}
	</li>
	<li>The <strong>client_id</strong> (API key) is checked to ensure it is your own.</li>
</ol>

<p>The access token you have now lasts for 1 hour. You can use it to make API requests which require 
authorization.</p>

<p>Once your token expires, you must send the user back to {{site.productName}} to retrieve a new token.</p>

<p>A sample client-side script is provided below:</p>

<h2 id="authorizations-api">Authorizations API</h2>

<p>An endpoint for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/rest-api/resources/#!/authorizations">Authorizations</a> 
is made available in the API. This makes it possible for you to handle a user's third party application authorizations on behalf of that user. This is primarily provided as a way to allow your own application to remove itself from the user's authorizations list. This comes in handy if the user asks your application to disconnect from {{site.productName}}.</p>
